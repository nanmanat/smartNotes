# Progressive Web App (PWA) Implementation

## Changes Made

The following changes have been made to implement PWA functionality in the Smart Notes application:

1. **Added Web App Manifest**
   - Created `/public/manifest.json` with app information and icon references
   - This allows the app to be installed on home screens

2. **Updated HTML with PWA Metadata**
   - Added theme color, description, and Apple-specific meta tags
   - Added links to the manifest and icons
   - This improves the app's appearance when added to home screens

3. **Added PWA Plugin to Vite Configuration**
   - Updated `vite.config.js` to use the vite-plugin-pwa plugin
   - Configured the plugin with app information and icon references
   - This automatically generates a service worker for offline functionality

4. **Added Service Worker Registration**
   - Updated `src/main.jsx` to register the service worker
   - Added handlers for updates and offline readiness
   - This enables offline functionality and update notifications

5. **Created Icon Directory Structure**
   - Created `/public/icons/` directory for PWA icons
   - Added a README with instructions for creating the required icon files

## Required Actions

To complete the PWA setup, you need to:

1. **Install the new dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

2. **Create the required icon files**
   - Create `/public/icons/icon-192x192.png` (192x192 pixels)
   - Create `/public/icons/icon-512x512.png` (512x512 pixels)
   - See `/public/icons/README.md` for more information

3. **Build and test the application**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   # or
   yarn build
   yarn preview
   ```

4. **Test on a mobile device**
   - Open the application on a mobile device
   - Add it to the home screen
   - Verify that it launches as a standalone app with the correct icon and splash screen

## Benefits

With these changes, the Smart Notes application now:

- Can be installed on home screens like a native app
- Works offline or with poor connectivity
- Has a proper app icon and splash screen
- Provides a more app-like experience on mobile devices
